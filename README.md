# Project 1: Exploring the Association Between SDP/ETS and Self-Regulation, Externalizing Behavior, and Substance Use

With the data which contain 49 individuals and 79 variables, we explored the missing patterns and did basic exploratory analysis on the variables.

In the report.pdf file, we first introduced the study aim and an overview of the data, with some tables listed summary statistics of variables of interest. Then in the Method and Result section, we examine the relationship between the three categories of outcomes and SDP/ETS. We also examine the within outcome and within predictor relationships, mostly with figures (Lasagna plots, scatter plots, box plots).

The overall conclusion is that, due to the poor quality of the data, we can't draw any useful conclusion on how SDP/ETS is affecting Self-Regulation, Externalizing Behavior, and Substance Use.

## Repository Structure

+ `report.qmd`: the code that generate the report.pdf

+ `report.rmd`: main report which contain main text and a pure code Appendix.

+ `./pre-processing`: Some preprocessing with the raw data

+ `./Figures`: the folders that contains selected figures

Note that due to data privacy, the repository would not contain either the original data or the cleaned data we used in this study.

## Report Overview
